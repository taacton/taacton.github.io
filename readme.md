# Toolbox
This toolbox is designed to contain all apps built to help the Account Managers. It will be added to periodically as the need arrises.

## App ID converter:
Used to convert an iOS App store ID to a Bundle ID or visa-versa, using Apples public API.

## Targeting list fixer:
Used to help AMs fix common issues with the targeting lists they are provided, which prevent them from being uploaded to the DSP. Currently the tool does the following:

- Outputs the correct unix style line-ending.
- Validates each IDFA in the file, removing bad ones.

## CSV Joiner: 
Used to merge multiple CSV files together.
